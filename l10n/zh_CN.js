If a file is identified as a virus, it is either logged or not uploaded to the server. The application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, which the admin points Nextcloud to when configuring the application. Alternatively, a Kaspersky Scan Engine can be configured, which has to run on a separate server.\nFor this app to be effective, the ClamAV virus definitions should be kept up to date. Also note that enabling this app will impact system performance as additional processing is required for every upload. More information is available in the Antivirus documentation." : "文件反病毒是Nextcloud的反病毒应用程序.\n\n* 🕵️‍♂️ 当用户上传文件时，它将会被检查\n* ☢️ 已经上传并被感染的文件将会被删除，并且会显示通知及/或通过电子邮件发送通知\n* 🔎 具有扫描所有文件的后台任务\n* ❓ 使用ClamAV（开源）, 卡巴斯基扫描引擎或者受ICAP 支持的扫描引擎\n\n此应用程序在文件上传到Nextcloud并写入存储空间之前，会先检查其是否含有病毒。 如果文件被识别为病毒，它将被记录下来或者不会被上传。管理员在设定应用程序的时候指定ClamAV病毒扫描引擎，则应用程序依赖于底层的ClamAV病毒扫描引擎。同时也可以指定卡巴斯基扫描引擎，但其必须在一台单独的服务器上运行。\n为了使该应用程序起到作用，ClamAV的病毒定义文件需要保持最新。也请注意，启用此应用程序将会影响系统的性能，因为每次上传均需要额外的处理。 更多的信息请参见“反病毒”文档。",
